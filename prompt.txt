Analyze attached Global Hunger Index reports (2006-2008) using only data from the attached documents. When information is incomplete/unavailable, state: "No sufficient evidence in source materials."

Analysis Protocol:
1. Data Validation Phase:
   - Cross-reference all claims across ≥2 reports;
   - Flag any contradictory findings with "[DATA CONFLICT]";
   - Prioritize examples containing:
     - Quantitative metrics (% change; e.g., "% reduction in stunting," GHI score changes);
     - Multi-year implementation (mentioned in ≥2 reports);
     - Replication evidence (≥2 countries/regions).
--
2. Thematic Filter:
Only address these themes if explicitly covered in 2006–2008 reports. If a theme lacks data in 2006–2008 reports, exclude it entirely from analysis:
- Governance & political stability;
- Conflict resolution & peacebuilding;
- Gender equity & women’s empowerment;
- Youth engagement;
- Climate resilience & adaptation;
- Food systems transformation;
- Local governance & community-led initiatives;
- Emergency response & resilience-building.

3. Structured Output Requirements:
A. Success Factor Matrix (Complete First):
| Theme | Country/Region | Time Frame | Key Policy/Program | Outcome Metrics | Source (ReportYear:Page) | Sustainability Evidence (Source)|

Example:
"
| Climate Resilience | Bangladesh | 2006-2008 | Coastal Embankment Project | 32% ↓ flood damage | GHI2006:45, GHI2008_Appendix:12 | Maintained 89% infrastructure post-2007 cyclones |
"

B. Narrative Synthesis Report:
Per theme:
  1. Global/Regional Context: Trends across 2006–2008 reports (e.g., *"3 reports highlight...").
  2. National Case Study:
    - Program/Policy: Name, timeframe, and context (e.g., post-conflict, drought);
    - Reported Outcomes: Metrics + verbatim quotes (e.g., *"GHI 2008 notes: ‘School feeding programs correlated with 9% enrollment rise’");
    - Scalability/Sustainability: Direct excerpts from reports (e.g., *"2006 Annex A warns: ‘Requires stable local governance’").
  3. Limitations: Critiques/alternative explanations only if mentioned in reports.

C. Visualization Blueprint:
Propose 1-2 visuals (e.g., animated timeline, comparative heatmap) containing:
- Data Points: Directly cited metrics (e.g., "GHI 2007, p. 18: 22% hunger reduction in Vietnam").
- Design Notes:
    - Sections: "Key Policies 2006–2008," "Regional Success Stories.";
    - Interactive elements (e.g., filters by theme/country).
- Source annotations (e.g., GHI2007:Chart3A).
If interactive elements lack sufficient data, propose static visuals instead.

4. Quality Assurance Measures:
Pre-Submission Checks:
A. Apply 3-Point Verification:
  - Every claim has year + page/section citations.
  - Zero extrapolation beyond 2006–2008 data.
  - Thematic relevance: Omit themes absent in reports.

B. Verification Commands: "Cross-validate [Country/Program] outcomes between [GHI200X:Page] and [GHI200Y:Section].".

C. Strict Prohibitions:
  - No extrapolation beyond report data;
  - No synthesis of disconnected findings without explicit report linkage.

D. Mandatory Tags:
  - [WEAK EVIDENCE]: Single-report claims without replication;
  - [CONTEXT GAP]: Missing prerequisite details in reports.
